READ ME SPORT - SKILL - SCIENCE


Overview of our used files

- Dataframes load and read in python 	-> Sports project.ipynb
	Two datasets
	- Sports&Skills.csv		-> toughestsport
	- Supplements.csv		-> Sports Supplements

- SQL databas with tables 		-> sport_skill_supplements
- ER Diagramm				-> Entity_Relationship_Diagramm.mwb
- SQL queries (Basic)			-> sql_queries
- SQL queries for Triathlon 1		-> querie_triathlon_short_middle
- SQL queries for Triathlon 2		-> querie_triathlon_middle_long
- SQL queries for skills		-> Skills_min_max_for_supplements
- SQL queries for Supplements		-> top_recommended_supplements
 

- Some CSV files for loading in python	-> top5_supplements_not_repeated, top5_supplements, top_20_sports, skills_total_value 
- Using Matplotlib for visualization	-> Matplot.ipynb

- Presentation				-> as PDF


In Sports project, we created a connection between Python and MySQL Workbench to create and load the data from the two DataFrames in SQL 
(Output database with data from the two csv.files (toughestsport.csv, Supplements.csv) ---> sport_skill_supplements
Before exporting, we cleaned the data a little and reduced it to the essential (required) amount.
We then used SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to analyze and evaluate the data and exported this data via CSV to make it readable for VS Code/Python
in order to display it graphically.

Our database essentially consists of three tables (Entity_Relationship_Diagramm)
- All sports with the respective score for the 10 skills (11 column)
- All skills combined with alls sporttypes as a melted table
- All supplements related to sports and skills

We analyzed and evaluated a total of 60 sports for 10 skills and added a multi-sport (triathlon) that was not yet in the database.
- Ranking of sports by skills (without multisport)
- Ranking of the most important skills in sport without reference to sports (as an evaluation from the 60 sports)
- Creation of a skill score for triathlon
- Analysis of the most important supplements in sport with reference to the most important skills in sport and in particular to triathlon


Short-Explenation of the skills
ENDURANCE: The ability to continue to perform a skill or action for long periods of time. Example: Lance Armstrong

STRENGTH: The ability to produce force. Example: NFL linebackers.

POWER: The ability to produce strength in the shortest possible time. Example: Barry Bonds.

SPEED: The ability to move quickly. Example: Marion Jones, Maurice Green.

AGILITY: The ability to change direction quickly. Example: Derek Jeter, Mia Hamm.

FLEXIBILITY: The ability to stretch the joints across a large range of motion. Example: Gymnasts, divers.

NERVE: The ability to overcome fear. Example: High-board divers, race-car drivers, ski jumpers.

DURABILITY: The ability to withstand physical punishment over a long period of time. Example: NBA/NHL players.

HAND-EYE COORDINATION: The ability to react quickly to sensory perception. Example: A hitter reacting to a 
breaking pitch; a drag racer timing acceleration to the green light.

ANALYTIC APTITUDE: The ability to evaluate and react appropriately to strategic situations. Example: Joe Montana reading a defense; basketball point guard on a fast break.
